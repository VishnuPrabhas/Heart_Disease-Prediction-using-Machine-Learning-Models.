# Heart_Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Models.
This database contains 14 attributes. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 1(presence).

Supervised Learning models K-NN and Naive Bayes are used along with AdaBoost ensembling method to boost the model accuracy of Naive Bayes.
